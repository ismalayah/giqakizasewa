When he was chosen as the dormitory’s leader in episode 6, he saved Mai from an early exit. Then, we got a taste of her gamer mentality — the sort of me-above-anyone-else mantra she adhered to that propelled her to the seven-figure payday. Instead of following the plan of maintaining an all-female alliance, she chose to save Chad — her closest ally — instead of picking another woman.</p><p data-characters=291 data-current-count=291 data-injectable=false>Mai’s social game paid dividends again when T.J. randomly selected No. 20, the last number having to traverse “Glass Bridge,” and gave it to her. Although the former basketball player <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">“fell” to his demise</a>, Mai passed the game without putting herself in danger.</p><p data-characters=543 data-current-count=834 data-injectable=true>T.J.’s inclusion of Mai was a storyline that elevated her edit. And then she became a focal point for the rest of the season. Clocking how <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">No. 278 Ashley didn’t jump when she was supposed to</a> — according to the cast’s agreed upon plan — Mai targeted her during the next dormitory elimination. But, the game of dice didn’t lead to Ashley’s’ exit, and the remaining players became leery of Mai’s instinct. She became a villain among the contestants. But, that didn’t slow Mai’s momentum.</p><p data-characters=325 data-current-count=325 data-injectable=false>Heading into the “Circle of Truth” competition, virtually all of Mai’s key allies were gone. Chad was taken out during the dice game. Speaking with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Screen Rant</a> ahead of the finale airing, the Vietnamese-born contender said that although a few players were somewhat in her corner, she was on an island alone.</p><p>“I think the support had diminished when I selected Ashley, but, at the same time, there was still a little hope from [No. 418] Roland, [No. 016] Sam, and Phil. [They’d] give me that little support but yet stand back because they [didn’t] trust me; I just wanted to take out their friend. It was hard because you have to put on your game face and show that you’re not vulnerable because your friend has been taken out, or something like that. You have to stay strong.”</p><p data-characters=149 data-current-count=149 data-injectable=false>According to the edit, Mai was closest to Roland. Even so, Mai pulled a cutthroat and genius move during the game at the expense of the 23-year-old.</p><p data-characters=445 data-current-count=594 data-injectable=true>Circle of Truth, a game that didn’t appear in Squid Game, had players sitting in a circle blindfolded. During every round of play, a guard chose one of them to put another contestant on death row by placing a gift box on their desk. The person who received the box then had to determine who gave it to them. If they were right, the gifter was eliminated. But, if they were incorrect, they’d be escorted out of the game hall for good.</p><p data-characters=391 data-current-count=391 data-injectable=false>Mai was the first player chosen. And knowing no one would expect it, she placed the box on Roland’s desk. Convinced it wasn’t Mai, Roland determined it was No. 051 Rose and was eliminated. Mai faced instant elimination a few rounds later when No. 429 Elliot placed the gift in front of her. But, Mai used the experience she garnered in her adjudication career and ousted Elliot.</p><p data-characters=388 data-current-count=779 data-injectable=true>“Circle of Truth” ended with three players left standing — Mai, Phill, and Sam. Phill and Sam were ride-or-die allies, and Mai knew she was outnumbered. With the odds against her, she made it through the last dormitory elimination when they had to push a button to illuminate a light. Mai went first, and her button shined grey, meaning she was neither safe nor eliminated.</p><p data-characters=301 data-current-count=301 data-injectable=false>Sam went next, and he had a 50-50 chance of going home or taking Phill to the final. But, the square symbol he picked went red and his campaign came to an abrupt halt. With Mai and Phill remaining out of the field of 456 contestants, they faced off in the aforementioned game of Rock, Paper, Scissors.</p><p data-characters=350 data-current-count=651 data-injectable=true>Mai said in a confessional at the beginning of the game that she played Rock, Paper, Scissors a lot as a child, and by constantly reading Phill, she dominated it. Whenever someone won a round, they selected a key from a container and attempted to unlock a safe. After several rounds, Mai chose the correct key and unlocked it, signaling her triumph.</p><p data-characters=485 data-current-count=485 data-injectable=true>Mai spoke with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Men’s Health</a> ahead of the finale, and she revealed that when she entered Squid Game: The Challenge, she brought with her a competitive spirit that was willing to drive her toward the $4.56 million. “When I walked into the dormitory for the first time, I thought the character I have as a person is outside the dormitory, and my new persona in the dormitory is that of a competitive person,” she said. “It was like Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.”</p><p data-characters=71 data-current-count=71 data-injectable=false>Well, her attitude of doing whatever she needed to was the right call.</p><p data-characters=187 data-current-count=258 data-injectable=false>Mai is Squid Game: The Challenge’s sole champion. But, with Netflix <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">already casting</a> for <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">season 2</a>, she’ll have company in the winner’s circle at some point down the line.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y4tM5mrqimXai%2BtrXDZp6apZViwamxjJyfmqScmruosY4%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwho-won-squid-game-the-challenge.html&text=Who%20won%20Squid%20Game%3a%20The%20Challenge%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwho-won-squid-game-the-challenge.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwho-won-squid-game-the-challenge.html&title=Who%20won%20Squid%20Game%3a%20The%20Challenge%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwho-won-squid-game-the-challenge.html&title=Who%20won%20Squid%20Game%3a%20The%20Challenge%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwho-won-squid-game-the-challenge.html&title=Who%20won%20Squid%20Game%3a%20The%20Challenge%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwho-won-squid-game-the-challenge.html&description=Who%20won%20Squid%20Game%3a%20The%20Challenge%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./406471-bob-barker-is-engaged-at-99-and-made-it-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Bob Barker Is 'Engaged' at 99 &amp;amp; Made It to 39 Years with His Younger Girlfriend Timeline of Host'">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./kristen-hancher.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Kristen Hancher- Wiki, Biography, Age, Height, Net Worth, Boyfriend">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
