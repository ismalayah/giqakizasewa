But if that’s the definition of a lab leak, Jim, then it’s still a natural occurrence.”&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=191 data-current-count=191 data-injectable=false>Fauci’s attempt to try and lead the public into believing that even if COVID-19 started from a lab leak that it’s still natural, contradicts explanations by other doctors and scientists.</p><p data-characters=124 data-current-count=315 data-injectable=false>One of those scientists is Dr. Stephen Quay, who believes that the COVID-19 pandemic actually did arise from a lab accident.</p><p data-characters=340 data-current-count=655 data-injectable=true><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Newsweek reported</a> earlier this week that Quay was shut down during the pandemic by the powers that be. Quay also explained, “I found that when you looked at this virus, it had none of the properties of natural infection and still doesn’t to this day. To me, it looks much more like what would happen as a result of a lab accident.”<br></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=130 data-current-count=430 data-injectable=true>There were also emails <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">released earlier this month</a> that suggest an attempt to ensure that the lab leak theory itself was targeted.</p><p data-characters=294 data-current-count=294 data-injectable=false>The theory gained significant momentum early in the pandemic because the Wuhan Institute of Virology researches coronavirus in bats and everyone including Fauci agrees that the COVID-19 outbreak began in Wuhan. Fauci has theorized that it began naturally less than ten miles from the lab.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=498 data-current-count=792 data-injectable=true>During 2020, Fauci continuously referred to a study conducted by many highly regarded scientists that concluded a lab leak was highly unlikely. However, the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">newly released emails</a> show that Fauci himself commissioned that very study, despite never mentioning that important tidbit publicly. They also reveal that Dr. Kristian Andersen, who was a part of creating the study, writing in an email, “Our main work over the last couple of weeks has been focused on trying to disprove any lab theory.”</p><p data-characters=95 data-current-count=95 data-injectable=false>The communication in the emails strongly suggests that the study had a less-than-honest agenda.</p><p data-characters=128 data-current-count=223 data-injectable=false>Although Brand mentions neither the emails, nor Dr. Stephen Quay, he does mention another news piece from the last several days.</p><p data-characters=209 data-current-count=432 data-injectable=true>Brand showed clips from an NBC Nightly News segment speculating whether COVID-19 began due to transmission from raccoon dogs. In the segment, it’s basically pointed out that the theory is a stretch, at best.</p><p data-characters=225 data-current-count=225 data-injectable=false>Using raccoon dogs as his running joke of the video, Brand asks, “Do you notice Anthony Fauci’s willingness to investigate meandering theories around raccoon dogs and people popping up into the woods and getting a bat?”</p><p data-characters=235 data-current-count=460 data-injectable=false>However, Brand’s conclusion on why Fauci insists it’s not a lab leak is no joking matter. Brand concludes, “He (Fauci) is never willing to investigate roots of analysis that might lead to personal or institutional culpability.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2S%2Ftr%2FSnqOlZZKnrq%2BwjK2YpJ2jYq6vwMeopbJllpbCpLWMraZmrJGouG671Z6pZqSRl3q1tMSoqbJn</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2frussell-brand-takes-anthony-fauci-to-task-over-lab-theory.html&text=Russell%20Brand%20takes%20Anthony%20Fauci%20to%20task%20over%20lab%20theory&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2frussell-brand-takes-anthony-fauci-to-task-over-lab-theory.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2frussell-brand-takes-anthony-fauci-to-task-over-lab-theory.html&title=Russell%20Brand%20takes%20Anthony%20Fauci%20to%20task%20over%20lab%20theory" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2frussell-brand-takes-anthony-fauci-to-task-over-lab-theory.html&title=Russell%20Brand%20takes%20Anthony%20Fauci%20to%20task%20over%20lab%20theory" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2frussell-brand-takes-anthony-fauci-to-task-over-lab-theory.html&title=Russell%20Brand%20takes%20Anthony%20Fauci%20to%20task%20over%20lab%20theory" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2frussell-brand-takes-anthony-fauci-to-task-over-lab-theory.html&description=Russell%20Brand%20takes%20Anthony%20Fauci%20to%20task%20over%20lab%20theory" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./penny-marshalls-net-worth-biography-fact-career-awards-and-life-story.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Penny Marshalls net worth, biography, fact, career, awards and life story">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./penelope-horner.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Penelope Horner movie reviews &amp;amp; film summaries">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
