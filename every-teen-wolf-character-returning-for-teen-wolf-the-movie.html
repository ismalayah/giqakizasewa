The main villain was revealed to be the nogitsune coming back from Season 3B as well as other revelations such as an emotional ending confirmed by Jeff Davis and the return of a seemingly alive Alison Argent. Teen Wolf fans were definitely fed yesterday, however it still felt a little disheartening to know that Dylan O’Brien and Arden Cho won’t be returning, especially with the nogitsune arc being the main focus again. However, even if your favorites aren’t coming back, the majority of the cast did actually return and reunite onset for this project like a nice little Beacon Hills family reunion, but who was there?</p>Recommended Videos<h3 id=h-tyler-posey-as-scott-mccall data-injectable=false>Tyler Posey as Scott McCall</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/tyler-posey.jpeg><p data-characters=464 data-current-count=764 data-injectable=true>Teen Wolf‘s leading man and biggest fan has always been Tyler Posey, who plays Scott McCall, a human-werewolf hybrid. Posey was calling for a reboot or even a new Teen Wolf project alongside the fans before the film was even announced. You can tell he really loves this role and the world Jeff Davis has built around him, so it completely checks out that Posey was one of the first to sign on. After all, there is no Teen Wolf without the true Alpha himself.</p><h3 id=h-holland-roden-as-lydia-martin data-injectable=false>Holland Roden as Lydia Martin</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/holland-roden-1.jpeg><p data-characters=492 data-current-count=792 data-injectable=true>After Alison, Lydia Martin was the next leading female role. Holland Roden brought this surface-level mean girl to life with hidden intellect and sass beneath what everyone assumed was the basic high school ‘dumb blonde’ trope. Lydia came to be an even more prominent character in Season 2 when we found out she had something supernatural residing within her. She’s a character full of depth and it will be exciting to see what she’s been up to since we last saw her.</p><h3 id=h-colton-haynes-as-jackson-whittemore data-injectable=false>Colton Haynes as Jackson Whittemore</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/colton-haynes.jpeg><p data-characters=511 data-current-count=811 data-injectable=true>Colton Haynes, who plays Jackson Whittemore (a werewolf/kanima), is also returning for the movie. He was known as the jerky jock who antagonized Scott and Stiles during Season 1 and then in Season 2 became the main villain as the Kanima. He went through a lot of character development over those two seasons and then returned in the final season of the series having came out as gay to which Lydia, his ex, said she wasn’t surprised. It’ll be exciting to see Jackson come into his own in this movie.</p><h3 id=h-tyler-hoechlin-as-derek-hale data-injectable=false>Tyler Hoechlin as Derek Hale</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/tyler-hoechlin.jpeg><p data-characters=368 data-current-count=668 data-injectable=true>Everyone’s favorite sour wolf, Derek Hale, is also returning. Derek Hale is played by Tyler Hoechlin who many now know as Superman on the CW’s Superman and Lois. Interestingly, Derek will have a son in the upcoming move, but no one knows who the mother is or what Derek’s been up to, but apparently his son, Eli Hale, will be a big part of the film.</p><h3 id=h-crystal-reed-as-alison-argent data-injectable=false>Crystal Reed as Alison Argent</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/crystal-reed.png><p data-characters=424 data-current-count=724 data-injectable=true>A surprising return for the movie was Crystal Reed, who plays Alison Argent, Scott’s first love. She actually died back in Season 3B during the original nogitsune plot line, so having her return from the dead (potentially) for the nogitsune’s return will be exciting. It’s uncertain how she’s coming back, but in the trailer, Scott told her father that she was alive, so we’ll see what happens.</p><h3 id=h-melissa-ponzio-as-melissa-mccall data-injectable=false>Melissa Ponzio as Melissa McCall</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/melissa-ponzio.jpeg><p data-characters=383 data-current-count=683 data-injectable=true>One of television’s best mothers is Melissa McCall, played by Melissa Ponzio. The mother of Scott, Melissa is a hardworking nurse who ended up biting off more than she could chew when finding out about the supernatural. When the series ended, she had gotten together with Alison’s father, Chris, so we’re excited to see if they’re still a couple in the film.</p><h3 data-injectable=false>Ian Bohen as Peter Hale</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/ian-bohen.jpeg><p data-characters=393 data-current-count=693 data-injectable=true>Every show has one — the character you love to hate — and Peter Hale is just that. He’s betrayed the pack multiple times throughout the series and even came back from the dead, so there’s really no telling what Peter’s next moves are. All we know is that Ian Bohen does one hell of a job playing him and that we’re sure to see some more Hale mischief in the movie.</p><h3 id=h-shelley-hennig-as-malia-tate data-injectable=false>Shelley Hennig as Malia Tate</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/shelley-hennig.jpeg><p data-characters=402 data-current-count=702 data-injectable=true>Malia Tate was a Season 3 addition to the show and immediately became a fan-favorite. Played by Shelley Hennig, Tate is a werecoyote and was trapped in coyote form for half of her life. She’s a little clueless and aggressive at times, but overall a lovable character. At the end of the series, we saw her and Scott find their way together, but what will Alison’s return mean for the couple?</p><h3 id=h-dylan-sprayberry-as-liam-dunbar data-injectable=false>Dylan Sprayberry as Liam Dunbar</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/dylan-sprayberry.jpeg><p data-characters=430 data-current-count=730 data-injectable=true>The baby werewolf of the pack is also back. Liam Dunbar will be making his return in Teen Wolf: The Movie, played by Dylan Sprayberry. Many fans loved him for his cluelessness and realistic anger issues on the show. They also loved shipping him with a character by the name of Theo, who, as of right now, has been confirmed by the actor will not be returning. Liam, though, will be back in all of his dramatically clueless glory.</p><h3 id=h-linden-ashby-as-sheriff-noah-stilinski data-injectable=false>Linden Ashby as Sheriff Noah Stilinski</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/linden-ashby.jpg><p data-characters=462 data-current-count=762 data-injectable=true>While we’re not getting Stiles back, we are getting the next best thing: his father. Sheriff Noah Stilinski has held down the fortress to protect Beacon Hills to the best of his ability, even before he knew about the supernatural happenings in the town. It’ll be interesting to see where his story leads — considering his wife has passed and Stiles isn’t returning — but regardless, it’s exciting to see the return of this character.</p><h3 data-injectable=false>JR Bourne as Chris Argent</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/JR-Bourne.jpg><p data-characters=384 data-current-count=684 data-injectable=true>Alison’s father, Chris, is played by JR Bourne and he’s always been a little wishy-washy on which side he fights for. He was raised as a werewolf hunter, but eventually joined the pack after Alison’s death and noting the sacrifices she had made. Chris and Alison’s reunion will surely be an emotional scene, so we’d better have some tissues at the ready.</p><h3 id=h-ryan-kelley-as-jordan-parrish data-injectable=false>Ryan Kelley as Jordan Parrish</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/ryan-kelley.jpeg><p data-characters=325 data-current-count=625 data-injectable=true>Jordan Parrish, while introduced to be a major character, ended up playing a more minor role. He was a hellhound and had a slight romance with Lydia (even though she was in high school), but it never really developed. If there’s anything to hope for for Parrish, it’s to give him a deeper storyline in the movie.</p><h3 id=h-seth-gilliam-as-dr-deaton data-injectable=false>Seth Gilliam as Dr. Deaton</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/seth-gilliam.jpeg><p data-characters=514 data-current-count=814 data-injectable=true>Dr. Deaton, also known as Scott’s boss at the Veterinary clinic, has always been a kind-hearted character that fans love. Played by Seth Gilliam, Deaton has always been a helpful and watchful eye for Scott and his pack. Originally, he was introduced as a normal human, only for him to later be revealed as a Druid. He’s usually the wise advisor that the pack goes to for help regarding the supernatural, so it’s certain that he’ll be making his fair share of appearances in this new movie.</p><h3 data-injectable=false>Khylin Rhambo as Mason Hewitt</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/khylin-rhambo.jpeg><p data-characters=414 data-current-count=714 data-injectable=true>Liam Dunbar’s best friend is none other than Mason Hewitt. He was introduced in Season 4 along with Liam and was eventually revealed to be the main villain of the season, but the pack was able to save him. Last we saw of Mason, he was happily dating another Chimera, Corey. In the trailer, we see that Mason has joined the police force, which is a huge development from the uninspired teenager he used to be.</p><h3 id=h-orny-adams-as-coach-finstock data-injectable=false>Orny Adams as Coach Finstock</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/orny-adams.jpeg><p data-characters=455 data-current-count=755 data-injectable=true>Finally, we come to Orny Adams, who will thankfully be reprising his role as Coach Bobby Finstock. Coach was a character who was the sometimes much-needed comic relief and we all love him for it. There were many running gags with the character, such as his hatred for a never-seen character named Greenburg. Even behind the scenes though, Orny was improvizing many of his lines and even admitted that he stopped reading the scripts after a certain point.</p><p data-characters=385 data-current-count=385 data-injectable=false>These are all of the returning actors we know of so far for Teen Wolf: The Movie, but perhaps more will be announced in the future or Teen Wolf fans will be gifted some surprise appearances. Characters that are definitely not returning though — as confirmed by their actors — are Kira Yukimura (Arden Cho), Theo Raeken (Cody Christian), and Stiles Stilinski (Dylan O’Brien).</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJonK%2Bdoq56tbHEp2Swp5ybeqS0wKuYnKyVp3qzsdOuqaehnpx6p7vRZquenZ5ixLC4xWaroZ1dory3tcRo</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fevery-teen-wolf-character-returning-for-teen-wolf-the-movie.html&text=Every%20Teen%20Wolf%20character%20returning%20for%20Teen%20Wolf%3a%20The%20Movie&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fevery-teen-wolf-character-returning-for-teen-wolf-the-movie.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fevery-teen-wolf-character-returning-for-teen-wolf-the-movie.html&title=Every%20Teen%20Wolf%20character%20returning%20for%20Teen%20Wolf%3a%20The%20Movie" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fevery-teen-wolf-character-returning-for-teen-wolf-the-movie.html&title=Every%20Teen%20Wolf%20character%20returning%20for%20Teen%20Wolf%3a%20The%20Movie" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fevery-teen-wolf-character-returning-for-teen-wolf-the-movie.html&title=Every%20Teen%20Wolf%20character%20returning%20for%20Teen%20Wolf%3a%20The%20Movie" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fevery-teen-wolf-character-returning-for-teen-wolf-the-movie.html&description=Every%20Teen%20Wolf%20character%20returning%20for%20Teen%20Wolf%3a%20The%20Movie" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./gilmore-girls-why-logan-call-rory-ace.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Gilmore Girls: Why does Logan call Rory Ace?">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./elizabeth-banks-takes-walk-shame-red-band-trailer.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Elizabeth Banks Takes The Walk Of Shame In Red Band Trailer">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
