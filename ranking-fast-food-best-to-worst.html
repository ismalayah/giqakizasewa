Opinions about each chain are mixed, given many people have had different experiences with the companies’ food, service, and ethics. So from pizza places to burger joints to mega-coffeehouses, here are 10 fast food restaurants ranked from worst to best.</p><h2 id=h-10-burger-king data-injectable=false>10. Burger King</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=688 data-injectable=true><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Burger King (@burgerking)</a></p>Image via Burger King’s Instagram</figure><p data-characters=404 data-current-count=404 data-injectable=true>According to its website, more than 11 million people visit Burger King restaurants worldwide daily. Founded in 1954, Burger King is one of the largest fast food hamburger chains in the United States. Originally named Insta-Burger King, it ran into financial difficulties back in 1954 and was purchased by some franchisees and renamed Burger King. It’s the home of the Whopper, its signature hamburger.</p><p data-characters=610 data-current-count=610 data-injectable=true>In recent years, Burger King has taken to trolling fast food rival McDonald’s in its advertising. At one point, it had “Scary Clown Night,” which offered a free Whopper to anyone dressed as a clown (eluding to McDonald’s mascot Ronald McDonald) on Halloween. While its advertising might be amusing, many people believe the food is subpar and of low quality. There are other more serious reasons why people are hesitant to go to the burger joint, including legal issues surrounding the false representation of its products, problematic advertising campaigns, and its abundance of unhealthy menu options.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>9. Domino’s Pizza</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Domino's Pizza (@dominos)</a></p>Image via Domino’s Pizza, Inc.’s Instagram</figure><p data-characters=430 data-current-count=730 data-injectable=true>Domino’s started from humble beginnings as a single pizza restaurant in 1960. Since then, it has become one of the world’s most prominent leaders in pizza delivery. Domino’s has impacted the entire food delivery industry with the following: the use of patented insulated bags to keep pizzas hot during delivery; a sturdy, corrugated pizza box that keeps moisture from weakening the box; and the 3-D car-top sign.</p><p data-characters=226 data-current-count=226 data-injectable=false>Despite being a huge chain, many think Domino’s lacks flavor, texture, and quality. Those who have qualms with the pizza cite its watered-down sauce, dry crust, and mushy cheese as the main reasons for its inferior rank.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>8. KFC</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=526 data-injectable=true><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Kentucky Fried Chicken (@kfc)</a></p>Image via KFC’s Instagram</figure><p data-characters=539 data-current-count=539 data-injectable=true>KFC, or Kentucky Fried Chicken, claims to have “world famous fried chicken” and boasts on its website that it practically invented fried chicken. KFC began in 1930 when 40-year-old Harland Sanders began feeding hungry travelers in a humble service station in Corbin, Kentucky. He then spent the next nine years perfecting his secret blend of 11 herbs and spices and the basic cooking techniques still used by KFC today. Currently, there are over 24,000 KFC locations around the world in more than 145 countries and territories.</p><p data-characters=400 data-current-count=400 data-injectable=true>Since its inception, Colonel Sanders has been its mascot with his signature goatee, black frock coat, and string tie. And although Harland Sanders passed away in 1980, he remains an icon of the company and its international symbol of hospitality. Its slogan, “finger-lickin’ good,” has endured since 1956 and went on to become one of the most well-known slogans of the 20th century.</p><p data-characters=428 data-current-count=428 data-injectable=true>The company has been involved in criticism and controversy surrounding animal welfare, links to obesity, and environmental impact. While some view KFC as having addictive chicken, others wonder if its founder would be pleased with the product today since many view it as having decreased quality and tastiness over the years. That, plus its higher prices and slow service, bumps KFC down on the list of notable fast food places.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>7. Subway</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by @subway</a></p>Image via Subway’s Instagram</figure><p data-characters=462 data-current-count=762 data-injectable=true>Subway prides itself on having freshly-made, convenient, and affordable food. With its daily fresh-baked bread, flavorful subs, and meals you can feel good about eating, it’s no wonder Subway is one of the top fast food places. In general, Subway’s meals are low in sugar and a decent fiber and protein source. Many menu options are also jam-packed with fat and sodium, but one of the main selling points is the ability to customize your meal to your tastes.</p><p data-characters=180 data-current-count=180 data-injectable=false>While the longtime Subway slogan “Eat Fresh” indicates the fresh ingredients used, Subway has seen its popularity decrease in recent years as it needs a major brand renovation.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>6.

Its signature Baja Blasts and Cool Ranch Doritos Tacos took the world by storm and have become some of the most popular items on the Taco Bell menu. As of 2018, Taco Bell serves about 2 billion customers yearly at over 7,000 locations.</p><p data-characters=233 data-current-count=617 data-injectable=true>The Taco Bell strategy works despite embodying none of the traditional virtues such as organic products, embracing social causes, or promoting small businesses. In the past couple of decades, customer satisfaction has trended upward.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>5.

With a business model centered on franchises, there are almost 7,000 stores, most of which are located in North America. The chain is known for its square hamburgers, sea salt fries, and frosties, a form of soft-serve ice cream.</p><p data-characters=324 data-current-count=324 data-injectable=false>In 1984, actress Clara Peller was featured in a very successful advertising campaign with the slogan “Where’s the beef?” This line quickly became an American pop culture phenomenon. In addition to the iconic line, Wendy’s has also taken to Twitter, roasting customers and other fast food chains such as McDonald’s.</p><p data-characters=104 data-current-count=428 data-injectable=true>Its consistent quality and variety of food items make Wendy’s one of the better fast food restaurants.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>4.

It is the world’s largest restaurant chain based on revenue.

Its signature item is the Big Mac.</p><p data-characters=180 data-current-count=180 data-injectable=false>Some pros to eating at McDonald’s: cheap options, simple and quick ordering, and guilty-pleasure foods.
